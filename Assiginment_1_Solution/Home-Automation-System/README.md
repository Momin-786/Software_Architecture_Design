# Home-Automated-System-Software
================================
Coursework Specification

You have been approached to design prototype software for a home automation system. The idea is that one or more appliances or devices in a house could be controlled by a computer, enabling a user to interact with them by using the software directly or even, at a later stage, via the Internet.

Imagine, for example, being able to lock or unlock all of the house doors by pressing a button on the computer (similar to a car central locking system) or being able to add items to a shopping list stored on the computer, press a button and have the list sent to the grocery store.

Your task is to simulate this system using object-orientation and Java. The system should be designed in stages – designing and testing one section at a time. These stages will also correspond to a marking scheme. The more sophisticated your system design, the more marks you are liable to attain.

There are basic requirements:

• The system must be object-oriented and written in Java

• The system must have at least one class that models the house

• The system must have some sort of Graphical User Interface (GUI)

• The GUI component and the House class must not be one and the same (i.e., they should be de-coupled)

• The system must be designed according to good object-oriented principles as taught on the course

• There must be evidence of testing the system in the form of main methods and/or test classes

• Your code must be neat and conform to Java naming and coding recommendations
