## Introduction
This course covers the key principles and techniques used in designing and architecting robust software systems. You will explore methods to create software that is scalable, flexible, and maintainable, with real-world examples to demonstrate these concepts in action.

---

## Course Topics
The materials in this repository will guide you through various essential topics, including:
- **Core Software Design Principles** (e.g., SOLID, GRASP)
- **Architectural Patterns** such as Microservices, MVC, and Layered Architecture
- **Design Patterns** like Singleton, Factory, Observer, and more
- **Case Studies** illustrating the application of these principles in real-world scenarios

---

## Code Samples
To aid in understanding, the repository contains code snippets that demonstrate the practical implementation of the topics discussed. These examples can be found in the corresponding folders based on the topic, and they are organized for easy navigation and reference.

## Design Best Practices
Throughout the course, we emphasize the following key best practices:

- **Analyze the Problem**: Always invest time in fully understanding the problem before jumping to a solution.
- **Encapsulate and Abstract**: Use encapsulation and abstraction to keep components loosely coupled and reusable.
- **Simplicity Over Complexity**: Keep designs as simple as possible while addressing the problem’s requirements—don’t overcomplicate.
- **Test Early, Test Often**: Incorporate automated tests to ensure your designs are reliable and meet the requirements.
- **Document Thoughtfully**: Ensure that your code and design decisions are well-documented to aid future developers.
